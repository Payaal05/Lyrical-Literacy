## Abstract

Neuroscientific studies have revealed significant insights into how and why singing benefits the brain. This survey examines the neural and cognitive benefits of musical training and singing, focusing on their impact on language processing, cognitive development, and overall brain function. Key findings include the interconnection of neural networks for music and language, the activation of multiple brain areas during singing, enhanced auditory processing and memory, improved neural encoding of speech, and the development of phonological awareness. This research supports the inclusion of musical training in educational and therapeutic contexts, demonstrating its potential to enhance cognitive functions and promote brain health. This paper is part of the "Lyrical Literacy" project at Humanitarians.ai, which encourages "A song a day" with songbooks and SoundCloud songs for hundreds of public domain and simple songs written by Nik Bear Liam Williams Brown.

## Introduction

The relationship between musical training, particularly singing, and cognitive development has been a subject of increasing interest in both neuroscientific and educational research. Singing engages a broad network of brain areas, enhancing various cognitive functions and promoting overall brain health. This paper explores the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of singing on language and cognitive skills, reviewing key studies that demonstrate the significant benefits of musical engagement.

Musical training, especially in the form of singing, activates overlapping neural networks for music and language, facilitating mutual reinforcement of these skills. This engagement involves multiple brain areas, including the motor cortex, auditory cortex, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex, leading to enhanced auditory processing, memory, and neural encoding of speech. Furthermore, musical training aids in beat synchronization and phonological awareness, which are critical for language acquisition.

This survey is part of the "Lyrical Literacy" project at Humanitarians.ai, which promotes daily engagement with music through songbooks and SoundCloud songs. The project aims to harness the cognitive and social benefits of singing to foster language skills and overall brain development in diverse populations.

### Neural Mechanisms Underlying the Impact of Singing on Language and Cognitive Skills

#### Interconnection of Neural Networks for Music and Language

Research has consistently shown that music and language share overlapping neural networks, which facilitates mutual reinforcement of these skills. For example, Moreno (2009) demonstrates that music can modify the brain both functionally and structurally, indicating that musical training can improve language processing through shared neural circuits. This overlap suggests that engaging in music, particularly singing, can enhance language skills due to the interconnected nature of the brain areas involved.

#### Activation of Multiple Brain Areas

Singing activates more brain areas than any other activity, involving the motor cortex, auditory cortex, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex. This multi-faceted activation is supported by research indicating that musical training can enhance auditory processing and memory (Moreno, 2009). For instance, Koelsch (2009) discusses how music engages sensory processes, attention, memory-related processes, and perception-action mediation, all of which contribute to improved cognitive functioning.

#### Enhanced Auditory Processing and Memory

Enhanced auditory processing and memory are key benefits of singing, as highlighted by François and Schön (2011). Their study shows that musicians outperform non-musicians in segmenting a sung language, suggesting that musical training can enhance auditory perception and memory processes, which are crucial for language development. This improvement in auditory processing is also linked to structural changes in the brain, such as increased gray matter volume in the auditory cortex, as observed by Jäncke (2009).

#### Improved Neural Encoding of Speech

Singing improves the neural encoding of speech by enhancing the precision and strength of neural responses to sound. Patel (2011) introduces the OPERA hypothesis, explaining how musical training benefits the neural encoding of speech through adaptive plasticity in speech-processing networks. This plasticity leads to superior subcortical speech sound encoding, evidenced by shorter-latency brainstem responses and enhanced representation of speech harmonics.

#### Training Beat Synchronization

Training in beat synchronization is essential for language skills, as it involves the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which are crucial for timing and rhythm. Studies have shown that musical training enhances these skills, thereby improving language processing and speech perception. For instance, Strait and Kraus (2011) argue that music training enhances auditory processing and neural responses to speech, ultimately improving speech perception in noise and reading abilities.

#### Enabling Phonological Awareness

Musical training also enables phonological awareness, a critical component of language acquisition. Tierney and Kraus (2013) discuss how musical training enhances reading ability by improving various subskills underlying reading acquisition, such as phoneme recognition and rhyme awareness. This finding is supported by Milovanov and Tervaniemi (2011), who show that musical aptitude is significantly related to better phonemic discrimination and pronunciation skills in a second language.

## Conclusion

In summary, the neuroscientific evidence strongly supports the profound impact of singing on brain function. Singing engages a wide range of brain areas, enhancing cognitive functions and language skills through interconnected neural networks and extensive brain activation. These benefits are evident across various age groups and neurological conditions, underscoring the importance of musical engagement as both a therapeutic and cognitive enhancement tool.

The "Lyrical Literacy" project at Humanitarians.ai leverages these findings by encouraging daily singing practices, offering songbooks and SoundCloud songs to promote cognitive and social development. By enhancing auditory processing, memory, neural encoding of speech, beat synchronization, and phonological awareness, singing significantly contributes to improving language skills and overall brain health. Further research is needed to continue exploring these mechanisms and their applications in educational and therapeutic settings.
